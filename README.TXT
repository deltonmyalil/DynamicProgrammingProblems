Includes any problem I find that can be optimized using Dynamic Programming/Memoization
Will first try to do it with Brute Force, then will create another package that contains optimized solution

Fibonacci Generation with Recursion
    1. fibWithoutDP - Fib using recursion - runs at exponential time : O(2^n)
    2. fibWithDP - Fib using recursion and an ArrayList lookup to implement DP - runs at linear time: O(n)
